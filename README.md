1. Project Title / Headline

üå¶Ô∏è Weather Update Dashboard
A real-time, interactive dashboard delivering comprehensive weather forecasts, environmental conditions, and air quality metrics for multiple Canadian cities.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Weather & Air Quality Insights Dashboard provides users with current conditions, 7-day forecasts, air quality index breakdowns, and sunrise/sunset timings. It helps individuals plan their day while staying aware of health-related environmental conditions like CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM levels.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
‚Ä¢ üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Primary tool for data visualization and report design.
‚Ä¢ üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and preparation for weather and air quality feeds.
‚Ä¢ üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated metrics, conditional coloring, and dynamic visuals.
‚Ä¢ üåê API Integration ‚Äì Weather and air quality data pulled via live APIs (e.g., OpenWeather).
‚Ä¢ üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for Power BI project development, .png for report snapshots.

4. Data Source

Source: OpenWeather API.

Weather Data: Hourly and daily forecast values (temperature, humidity, visibility, precipitation, wind, UV index, sunrise/sunset times).

Air Quality Data: Pollutant-specific measurements (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, PM2.5, PM10) aggregated to an AQI index.

Forecast Rain Data: Probability of precipitation percentages per day.

5. Features / Highlights

‚Ä¢ Business Problem
Canadians face unpredictable weather and varying air quality conditions. Without a unified tool, it is difficult for individuals, businesses, and planners to stay informed and make health-conscious or operational decisions.

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a visually engaging and centralized platform that:

Summarizes real-time weather and air quality metrics.

Offers a 7-day forecast for informed planning.

Highlights environmental risks (e.g., hazardous air quality).

Helps both individuals (daily planning) and organizations (event management, logistics, healthcare alerts).

‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Current Weather (Top Left): Displays live city weather, conditions (overcast, sunny, rainy), and temperature comparison across cities.

Forecast Weather (Line Chart + Icons): 7-day temperature trend with visual condition icons.

Sunrise & Sunset (Right Panel): Daily sun timings for planning outdoor activities.

Key Metrics (Bottom Left Panel): Visibility, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, UV Index, and Precipitation in compact KPI cards.

Air Quality Index (Center): Circular gauge showing AQI score (407, Hazardous), with pollutant breakdown (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, PM10, PM2.5).

Chance of Rain (Bottom Right): Horizontal bar chart with percentage chance of rain across the week.

‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights

Health Awareness: Residents can protect themselves from hazardous air quality conditions (e.g., avoiding outdoor activity when AQI is high).

Logistics & Transportation: Companies can anticipate visibility, wind speed, and rain conditions for operational planning.

Event Planning: Outdoor event organizers can schedule based on rain chances and sunset times.

Community Safety: Local authorities can monitor environmental conditions to issue health advisories.
